## Buys feature

   * It is a simple idea, the initial or basic idea is that, when the person goes to the market to buy, they usually carry a paper list with the things they needed and that list often or month to month is very similar, it does not vary much, so, he always has to write everything on a piece of paper and then, as he picks up the products at the market, he crosses off the paper and adds up with the telephone calculator.

   * Initially all this process is done in the notes of the phone, but likewise, every time you have to be editing the notes, adjusting prices and once again you have the job of adding everything manually in the calculator of the phone, the application gathers all these functionality on the phone, the idea is that the app semi-automate this entire process.

   * You have a shopping list and as you pick up the products, you mark with a switch that considers said product in the sum and thus, at the end of marking the desired, you get the total to pay. You can also adjust prices according to the money you have at that time, you prioritize what product you carry and what not.

## Bills feature

   * This functionality is very similar to the shopping list, with other characteristics, since accounts payable have an expiration date and so as not to forget them, the app synchronizes them with the phone's calendar, sending alerts before the expiration of an account .
   
## Dashboard feature

   * The app has a dashboard or summary, where you define your budget and the period of time to use it and based on that, it generates "statistics", very simple, but useful.
